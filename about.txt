VoLTE Retrofit Project

Goal:
	Build an opensource ecosystem for rebasing older (Pre LTE) feature phones.

	Replace obsolite hardware of old cell phones (modem, motherboard) with new components (VoLTE modem, SBC, etc.)
	
Implementation:
	Use Proven Techbonoligies:
		Linux based
		Use already existing projects (ModemManager, etc.)
		Off the shelf VoLTE capable modems (e.g. Quectel EG25)
	Build a community:
		Open source "ports" that contain driver implementations for old hardware (keypads, displays, etc.)
 		Create a unified platform where programs can be written once and run on all phones
		

Features (core):
	Voice Calling (obvisouly)
	SMS
	MMS (including Group MMS)
	USB tethering
	T-9 support with predictive text
	Web/native desktop portal for configuring and using certian features (SMS/MMS, etc.) [web server runs on phone hosting a portal and other devices can log into that portal and use certain features of the phone]
	PIM features (contacts, detailed call statistics, calander, reminders, etc.)
	Fast performance (written in C, C++ only, no bloat)
	File manager
	Text Editor
	Other linux programs/scripts (adapted for low resolution LCDs of course)
	
	
Features (extra):
	Games
	Speech to text (runs on device)
	Music player
	GPS navigation (for supported modems)
	E-mail client

Hardware Features (potentially):
	kill switches
	external antennas (depends on device)
	bluetooth (with hands free)


New device potential:
	The work produced by this project should lower the barrier of entry for creating entirely new feature phones
